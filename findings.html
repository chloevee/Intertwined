          Research might sound intimidating, but here at Intertwined, we treat
          it more like stargazing. Every insight is just another star you can
          connect, another clue about how Filipino youth love, communicate, and
          build relationships today. Our findings come from real stories, real
          emotions, and real people trying to understand why dating feels the
          way it does. Think of this section as your cosmic map the place where
          data, culture, and lived experiences blend together to help you
          finally see the bigger picture.
