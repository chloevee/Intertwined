          <p>
            The Intertwined Project is a collective that aims to shed light on
            the realities of digital courtship in the Philippines. By exploring
            how dating apps shape the way Filipino youth experience romance and
            relationships, we hope to spark meaningful conversations and not
            only inform, but also encourage self-reflection and awareness among
            the youth and their parents.

            Communication and the development of relationships are highly
            influenced by the dynamics of mutual interaction? Individuals tend
            to mirror actions, styles or behavior of an individual which
            reflects their desire for connection and when faced with
            insincerity, there is a clear change in this behavior, and it can
            sometimes turn into what we call “defense mechanisms.” The
            communication patterns found, such as mirroring and casual
            communication, show…

              <p>
                We chose to explore the topic of digital courtship because
                dating apps have become a big part of how Filipino youth
                experience romance today. Many young people and their parents
                face emotional challenges, cultural stigma, and
                misunderstandings around online dating. Our goal is to shed
                light on these experiences, promote emotional awareness, and
                bridge the gap between traditional Filipino values and modern
                relationships.
